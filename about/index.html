    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Who am I? What do I want? My CV and my contacts.... BEHHHHHHH</p>
    <p>Have a fully honest about section.</p>
    <p>You are a captialist communist who hates everyone and everything but tries his best to love everyone and everything. You are making this website in case people want to look you up and because you don't like LinkedIn. You have obssessed about every inch of this and would like people to belive you haven't.</p>
    <p>You want to make the world a better place because you are selfish and believe this world is yours. You love econ but believe that if you were smarter you would have been a mathematician or physicist. You are a tall white guy who believes that he is not like the other tall white guys.</p>
    <p>You are trying to manipulate those reading this into thinking that you are their friend when you have no friends. You are scared of dying but trying not to be.</p>
